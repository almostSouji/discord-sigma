title: Data scrape bots
description: >-
  This rule detects users that are very freshly created or are forcefully transferred into the new username System.
  While this can act as an indicator of a spam account or scrape bot (which sits in a server without interacting with it, collecting data),
  other indicators should be present and considered.
  Usually, users will change their username from the default, if they are legitimate accounts with an interest of using the server.
